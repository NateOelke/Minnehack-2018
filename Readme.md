# Minnehack 2018
Our project for Minnehack 2018 focuses on the 'prevent sports injuries' prompt. We created a model to predict which exercise regimes have a bigger chance of causing an injury to a highschool football player.

The project consists of a website containing an online form that high schools will be able to fill out. The data will be stored as a .csv file where each row is one player entry. The .csv file will be fed to a deep neural network that uses regression to predict the chance of a player getting injured if they continue with their current workout regime. The prediction will be displayed on the results page to conclude our project.
